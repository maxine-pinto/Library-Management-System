# Library-Management-System
Library Management System (Python)
A simple text-file–based Library Management System built using Python.

This was my first Python project, developed together with my group mates as part of our coursework.
##
The system allows librarians to:

📚 Manage book inventory (books.txt)

👤 Register and track members (members.txt)

📖 Lend and return books with due dates (lend.txt)

🖥️ Navigate via a command-line menu

This project demonstrates core concepts in file handling, functions, loops, and conditional logic in Python.
It is designed for learning fundamental system design and file-based data management.
